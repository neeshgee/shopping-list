<h1>Shopping Trip</h1>

<h3>Final project for The Iron Yard, Cohort 4.</h3>

<p> Shopping Trip is a web app designed to make couponing easier for the user. Instead of jumping from site to site in order
to print coupons the user will be able to search using a keyword, then save the desired coupons to their "trip". Once the user
is ready to grocery shop they will be able to use the coupons already saved in their trip. </p>
